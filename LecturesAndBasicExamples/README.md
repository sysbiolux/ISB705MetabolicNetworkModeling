# Lectures and Examples 

## 1. Modelling Concept and Simple Examples
Learn about modelling concepts and explore simple examples, refer to Chapter 2 in the book 'Introduction to Systems Biology, Workbook for Flipped-classroom Teaching' by Sauter & Albrecht. [Available here for free](https://www.openbookpublishers.com/books/10.11647/obp.0291). 

Focus on examples 7, 11, and 13 in Chapter 2 (Find their coded versions in the folder `BasicExample`).

## 2. Introduction to the COBRA Toolbox
Lectures and exercises introducing the COBRA Toolbox for computational biology.

Read the courses slides in the `Lectures` folder, then do exercices 1 to 4 (`Practicals_day_1.docx` & `Practicals_day_2.docx`). A suggestion for  correction is available for each exercice. 

## 3. Metabolic Modelling & Introduction to the FASTCORMICS Pipeline: 
Lectures and exercises covering metabolic modeling and an introduction to the FASTCORMICS pipeline.

Have a look at the courses slides in the `Lectures` folder and the corresponding example script (`ISB705MetabolicNetworkModeling/Contextualization/Reconstruction/Tutorial/Fastcormics_example.mlx`), then do the exercice (`ISB705MetabolicNetworkModeling/Contextualization/Reconstruction/Tutorial/ISB705_2022_Metabolic_modelling_days.mlx`).

## 4. Quality Control 

Correspond to a set of scripts used to perform data quality control (for more informations, see the Readme of the `BasicModelQualityControl` folder).

## 5. Bibliography

- Introduction to the COBRA toolbox
- Large scale modelling & omics data integration with fastcore
- Keynote: Contextualization of Molecular Network Models and their Application to Cancer Biology
